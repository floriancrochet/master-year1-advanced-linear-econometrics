## 📘 Overview
This project investigates the **impact of students’ financial management on their academic performance**.  
It was conducted as part of the **Master 1 in Econometrics and Statistics – Applied Econometrics track** at the University of Nantes.  

**Objectives**
- Quantify the relationship between students’ financial behavior and their overall grade average  
- Evaluate endogeneity issues and apply appropriate econometric methods  
- Provide evidence-based insights to improve student well-being and performance  

The study is based on a self-collected dataset from students in the Loire-Atlantique region, combining social, academic, and financial variables to model GPA outcomes.

## ⚙️ Features
- Linear econometric modeling using OLS and 2SLS (Two-Stage Least Squares)  
- Statistical validation: tests for normality, heteroskedasticity, multicollinearity, and endogeneity  
- Stepwise model selection and instrument relevance testing  
- Visualization of descriptive and regression results under R  
- Forecasting and interpretation of academic success determinants

## ⚙️ Installation

Clone the repository and ensure required R packages are installed:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/budget-econometrics.git
cd budget-econometrics
Rscript -e 'install.packages(c("openxlsx","car","MASS","tidyverse","EnvStats","lmtest","PerformanceAnalytics","corrplot","sjPlot","ggplot2","leaps","AER"))'
```

---

## 📚 Usage Example

```r
# Load data
Budget <- read.xlsx("data/budget.xlsx")

# Fit linear model
model <- lm(MOYENNE ~ ASSIDUITE + STRESS + RESTAURANT + EMPLOI + AGE, data = Budget)

# Display summary
summary(model)

# Plot residuals
plot(model$residuals)
```

Additional analyses and plots are included in the Quarto script `script économétrie linéaire avancée.qmd`.

## 📊 Results

Example result:  
The analysis reveals that **financial stress, number of restaurant visits, and student employment** negatively affect GPA, whereas **good health, tutoring participation, and external financial support** have a positive influence.
